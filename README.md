Loudness Wars
===
This repository contains the code for a personal project I'm working on. The loudness wars refers to the decreasing dynamic range of the music industry. The overall loudness of popular music is increasing because record labels are adding increasing amounts dynamic compression.

Feel free to clone this repo and see for yourselfâ€”just feed loudness_wars.py a CSV file track titles and artists, and the program will output a CSV file with the overall loudness (among other attributes) of each song.
