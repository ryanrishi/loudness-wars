> I've since migrated these CSVs into a SQLite database.

These are the Billboard end-of-year charts from 1950 to present-day. Each file has chart position, artist, and song title.

Billboard charts from years prior to 1970 were scraped from http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/.

NOTE: for 1950-1955, there are only the top 30 songs on that site.

Billboard charts from 1970 on were scraped from https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/{year}/hot-100-songs.
